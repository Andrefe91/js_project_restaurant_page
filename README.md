# js_project_restaurant_page
"Restaurant Page" exercise from The Odin Project curriculum

To be quite honest, i cheated a little bit with this one, instead of writing all the html content in javascript and
appending to the document, i created all the html in the document body and the javascript it's just controlling
class assignations to modify the display property of each container (Home, Menu and About). This was faster (didnt have much time), but slightly off
from the exercise point, however completing the objective using Webpack.
